The project aimed to measure the air pollution mitigation capacity of urban and peri-urban forests by using innovative sensors and by engaging citizens throughout the process (i.e., experiment design, safekeeping of sensors, and dissemination of results) with the support of the WOWnature web-based platform, thus strengthening the argument in their favour as an effective policy to tackle air pollution.",
